It uses HEPA-filtered laminar airflow to minimize cross-contamination and maintain a sterile workspace. Built with stainless steel and toughened glass, it features advanced filtration, low noise operation, and easy-to-clean design. Ideal for laboratories, pharmaceuticals, and research applications.",
    description2: "Biological Safety Cabinet Class II Type A2 provides personnel, environmental, and product protection. Air flow is drawn around the operator into the front grill of the cabinet, which provides personnel protection. In addition, the downward laminar flow of HEPA-filtered air provides product protection by minimizing the chance of cross-contamination along the work surface of the cabinet. Because cabinet air has passed through the exhaust HEPA filter, it is contaminant-free (environmental protection).",
